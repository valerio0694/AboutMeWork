     <p>Hi, I'm Valerio and I was born on 6<sup>th</sup> June 1994 in Rome, where I still live today. I have been into sports since I was a child. It all started with swimming, but I soon realized that it was not the right sport for me. Therefore I tried to play football, but my life drastically changed when I met my first love, Basketball. I devoted thirteen years of my life to Basketball and I have grown up whatching Michael Jordan. My passion for sport was so huge that it pushed me to choose the Sport Science course at University and after three years I graduated at the top of my class.</p>

     <p> After university I started working as personal trainer at two gyms in Rome. My goals were to improve the health of my costumers and to help them achieve the body of their dreams. This is a job where you never stop studying. Every day new updates on the training method come out and to offer the best services I always keep up with them. If I had not studied Sport Science, I would have probably enrolled in computer engeneering, having always loved subjects such as math and computer science. When a friend of mine told me about the <b> CodeMaster </b> course I thought it was the right opportunity to learn this job. </p>

          <p class="one"> My main goal is to become a qualified professional who is always up to every situation thanks to the dedication and constant commitment that distinguish me. <br /> <b> Where do I see myself in three years? </b> <br /> Despite the obstacles and difficulties that life poses on the path of each of us, I certainly see myself on track for my personal and professional achievement. I'm an extremely positive person, I don't get knocked down easily, and I’m used to giving my all in everything I do and I know this will get me far, wherever this “far” is. </p>

            <li> I like challenges, facing them head-on and always setting new goals. </li>
            <li> I am motivated and ambitious by nature and I think with Talent Garden I can reach great goals. </li>
